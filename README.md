## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**mmanouni/mmanouni** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal webpage.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and JavaScript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing a web app
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with "Not Now"
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I might have the answer, I moght not.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: not for now.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: the usual male pronounce.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started this before i even test my webpage locally :D
